## Files to Keep in assets/img/

### Keep these specific folders:
- `assets/img/favicon/` - ✅ Used
- `assets/img/logo/` - ✅ Used
- `assets/img/offcanvas/` - ✅ Used
- `assets/img/menu/` - ✅ Used

## Summary

**All CSS files**: KEEP (9 files)
**All JS files**: KEEP (27 files including modules)
**Fonts folder**: KEEP (may be referenced by CSS)
**SCSS folder**: OPTIONAL - only needed if you plan to modify CSS

**Images to delete**: ~15+ unused folders

**Total Image Folders Being Used:**
- `assets/img/favicon/`
- `assets/img/logo/`
- `assets/img/offcanvas/`
- `assets/img/menu/`
- `assets/img/home-01/` (about, funfact, service, video, testimonial, award, footer)
- `assets/img/home-04/brand/`
- `assets/img/home-09/` (complete folder for index.html)
- `assets/img/about-us/about-us-4/`
- `assets/img/service/service-2/`
- `assets/img/contact/`

## Estimated Space Savings
Deleting unused image folders could save significant disk space (potentially 50-80% of image assets).

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Backup FIRST**: Create a backup of the entire assets folder before any deletion
2. **Conservative Approach**: Start by deleting just a few obviously unused folders, then test
3. **Delete unused folders**: Remove the folders marked with ❌
4. **Partial cleanup of home-01**: The `home-01` folder can be partially cleaned. You're only using:
   - `home-01/about/` - KEEP
   - `home-01/funfact/` - KEEP  
   - `home-01/service/` - KEEP
   - `home-01/video/` - KEEP
   - `home-01/testimonial/` - KEEP
   - `home-01/award/` - KEEP
   - `home-01/footer/` - KEEP
   - Other subfolders in home-01 can be deleted
5. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all 4 pages load correctly with images after each deletion
6. **SCSS folder**: Delete if you won't be compiling custom CSS (keep if you want to customize styles)
7. **mail.php**: Review if you're using the contact form functionality

## Cleanup Script (PowerShell)

Here's a script to help automate the cleanup (run from the Scalivium folder):

```powershell
# Backup first!
Copy-Item -Path "assets" -Destination "assets_backup" -Recurse

# Delete unused home-XX folders
$unusedFolders = @(
    "assets/img/home-02",
    "assets/img/home-03", 
    "assets/img/home-05",
    "assets/img/home-06",
    "assets/img/home-07",
    "assets/img/home-08",
    "assets/img/home-10",
    "assets/img/home-11",
    "assets/img/home-12",
    "assets/img/home-13",
    "assets/img/home-14",
    "assets/img/home-15"
)

foreach ($folder in $unusedFolders) {
    if (Test-Path $folder) {
        Remove-Item -Path $folder -Recurse -Force
        Write-Host "Deleted: $folder" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
}

# Delete other unused folders
$otherUnused = @(
    "assets/img/about-me",
    "assets/img/career",
    "assets/img/cv",
    "assets/img/error",
    "assets/img/inner-service",
    "assets/img/login",
    "assets/img/portfolio",
    "assets/img/product",
    "assets/img/shop-home"
)

foreach ($folder in $otherUnused) {
    if (Test-Path $folder) {
        Remove-Item -Path $folder -Recurse -Force
        Write-Host "Deleted: $folder" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
}

Write-Host "`nCleanup complete! Test your pages now." -ForegroundColor Cyan
```
